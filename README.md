## Installation

### If you have Gemfile

Add those lines to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capistrano', '~> 3.1'
    gem 'capistrano-yeoman'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

### If not - install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano-yeoman

## Usage

```ruby
# Capfile
require 'capistrano/yeoman'
```

```ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :linked_dirs, %w{node_modules app/bower_components}
after "deploy:updated", "yo:build"
```

and link your ...appdir/curent/dist folder in your nginx/apache/other web serwer.

## How it works?

After updating code on the server it:

1. installs yeoman (if its not already installed)
2. runs `npm install`
3. runs `bower install`
4. finally `$grunt build`

## Dependencies

Nodejs with npm have to be installed on your server. In case of using sass also ruby with compass should be in your PATH.

It's good to update the npm before first deploy (`sudo npm update npm -g`), but after that be sure that your deploying user has access to ~/.npm dir and ~/tmp (if it exist).

## Tasks

- yo:install - installs yeoman locally in node_modules (only if its not already installed)
- grunt:build
- bower:install
- npm:install
